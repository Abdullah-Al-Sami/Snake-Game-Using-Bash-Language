## üìò Project Description

The **Snake Game Using Bash** is a classic retro-style terminal game written entirely in Bash scripting.  
It runs directly in the terminal using **`tput`** for cursor control and **real-time key input** for movement.  
Players control a snake that grows longer by eating apples (`*`) while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

This project demonstrates the **power of Bash** for interactive scripting, dynamic screen rendering, and game logic without using any external dependencies.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop an interactive terminal-based Snake Game using only Bash.  
- Implement real-time input handling for movement (W, A, S, D keys).  
- Simulate game mechanics ‚Äî snake growth, scoring, and collision detection.  
- Use **ANSI escape sequences** and **tput** for terminal UI control.  
- Strengthen knowledge of loops, arrays, and process signals in Bash.
